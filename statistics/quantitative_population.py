'''
Relationship of the Mean, Median, and Mode
The relationship of the mean, median, and mode to each other can provide some information
about the relative shape of the data distribution. If the mean, median, and mode are
approximately equal to each other, the distribution can be assumed to be approximately
symmetrical. If the mean > median > mode, the distribution will be skewed to the left or
positively skewed. If the mean < median < mode, the distribution will be skewed to the
right or negatively skewed.

There is an ordering to these means if all values in data set are positive.
min <= harmonic mean <= geometric mean <= arithmetic mean <= max.
