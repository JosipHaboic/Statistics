1. Qualitiative = Categorical (Ordinal or Nominal)
-Ordinal like likert score e.g, strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree because it has an order
-Nominal like male and female , yes or no and nationality
2. Quantitative (Scale either discrete or continuous)
- Discrete like number of children where you can not have 2.5 either 1, 2, 3 etc
- Continuous like weight you can have 50 kg or 70.4 kg etc
to do analysis:
1: if you are comparing two or more type of data where all categorical you use chi square test.
2: if all continuous you use multivariate analysis
3: if comparing continous vs two categories you use t-test
4: if comparing continous vs more than two categories you use anova
