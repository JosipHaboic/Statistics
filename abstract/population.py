class ConceptualPopulation(Population):
    '''populations are non–existing, yet visualized, or imaginable, sets of measurements. This
       could be thought of characteristics of all people with a disease, now or in the near future, for
       instance. It could also be thought of as the outcomes if some treatment were given to a large group
       of subjects. In this last setting, we do not give the treatment to all subjects, but we are interested
       in the outcomes if it had been given to all of them.
       Examples:
       1. Bioavailabilities of a drug’s oral dose (relative to i. v. dose) in all healthy subjects under
          identical conditions.
       2. Presence or absence of myocardial infarction in all current and future high blood pressure
          patients who receive short–acting calcium channel blockers.
       3. Positive or negative result of all pregnant women who would ever use a particular brand of
          home pregnancy test.'''
